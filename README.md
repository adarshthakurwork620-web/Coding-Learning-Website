🚀 Built a Coding Learning Website using HTML & CSS
While learning HTML and CSS, I created this CodeLearn website to practice real-world layout, styling, and responsiveness.
It’s a beginner-friendly online coding learning platform with a simple UI, navigation bar, hero section, and call-to-action buttons.
This project helped me understand:


Page structure with HTML


Styling & layouts using CSS


Flexbox positioning


UI design basics


Still learning, still building. More features coming soon 💻🔥
